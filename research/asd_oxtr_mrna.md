## Abstract
This study explores the differential expression of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) mRNA levels in two basal forebrain regions, namely the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and ventral pallidum (VP), in autistic individuals compared to allistic (non-clinical) individuals. The research investigates the link between OXTR gene expression and protein product previously observed in the same brain regions. Using postmortem human brain tissue samples, fluorescent in-situ hybridization was employed to visualize OXTR mRNA, providing insights into cellular neuroanatomy. The results show significant upregulation of OXTR mRNA in autistic individuals in both the NBM and VP, which differed from the protein product distribution. These findings offer valuable information about the role of the oxytocin system in ASD and may contribute to our understanding of the neural circuits influencing ASD-related behaviors. This research emphasizes the significance of studying brain-specific mechanisms to contextualize the effects of oxytocin treatment and enhance our comprehension of ASD etiology.
